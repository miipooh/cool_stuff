TailsOS:
Have an empty USB
Download TailsOS Live from their website
Install Balena Etcher (This is how you will install TailsOS on a USB)
When you install, choose the "Enable Persistence" option

Pidgin Messenger:
This is the default messenger on TailsOS
There are a few options for messaging types here, but good options are XMPP or OTR
OTR:
To enable OTR, go to Pidgin Messenger settings and scroll until you see the checkbox for OTR and check
You will still need to have a chat server to talk on with OTR, so find a good IRC chat server or set up your own
XMPP:
To use XMPP, get an account with one of the XMPP server providers or host your own XMPP server

Still looking for a good Peer-to-Peer chat service alternative for Tails

Jump Box:
Set up Jump Box VPS on the cloud. 
No need to jump through multiple boxes because Tor already routes you through 3 servers
