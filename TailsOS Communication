TailsOS:
Have an empty USB
Download TailsOS Live from their website
Install Balena Etcher (This is how you will install TailsOS on a USB)
When you install, choose the "Enable Persistence" option

Note: All traffic on Tails is default routed through the Tor network. Connectivity will be slow, but it provides encryption and anonymity.
Tor is not fool-proof. If the owner of the end node (the last Tor server you jump through) is owned by the enemy, they could look at your traffic
Counter this by country-blocking enemy nations in the torrc config file. 
The NSA controls a number of Tor servers, but who cares if the NSA sees what you send. They're American.

Pidgin Messenger:
This is the default messenger on TailsOS
There are a few options for messaging types here, but good options are XMPP or OTR

OTR:
To enable OTR, go to Pidgin Messenger settings and scroll until you see the checkbox for OTR and check
You will still need to have a chat server to talk on with OTR, so find a good IRC chat server or set up your own

XMPP:
To use XMPP, get an account with one of the XMPP server providers or host your own XMPP server

Jump Box:
Set up Jump Box VPS on the cloud. 
No need to jump through multiple boxes because Tor already routes you through 3 servers before getting to your box
