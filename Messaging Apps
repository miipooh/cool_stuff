Messaging Apps:

Session Messenger:
Not associated to a phone number 
Communicate using public and private keys (both sides need to have the public IP of the ohter)
Uses same encryption standard as Signal
Routes all traffic through Loki Net (Tor/Onion-type server network and encryption)
Can run from smartphone or computer (computer is safer because the cell network will still know your device IMEI but you can spoof your computer MAC)

Briar Messenger:
Peer-to-Peer messaging app
End-toEnd encryption (like Signal)
Turn off the Cell Data usage and it becomes a fully offline messaging app
Send messages over Bluetooth or Wifi
Short range but unattributable, requires no intermediate servers or infrastructure, and blends in with normal wifi/BT traffic
